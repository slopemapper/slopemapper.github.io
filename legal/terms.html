      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        The Slopemapper app allows you to select a resort, specify your skiing ability, view the resort map, and find the
        shortest route from one slope or lift to another. </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        When using Slopemapper, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>You are responsible for ensuring that your device meets all necessary technical specifications to use the
          app and is compatible with the app. We do not guarantee that the app will be free from errors or
          uninterrupted.
        </li>
        <li>The routes and information provided by the app are based on the assumption that all lifts and slopes are
          open. You are responsible for verifying the conditions with the resort directly, as the availability and
          conditions of slopes and lifts can change rapidly (lifts and pistes can close at any time). We do not
          guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information provided by the app. Any reliance on
          the information provided is at your own risk.
        </li>
        <li>You are responsible for assessing the safety of the route. We do not accept any responsibility or liability
          for the safety or suitability of the routes suggested by the app. Slopemapper is not a safety device and must not be
          relied upon as a navigation safety tool. Your safety is your responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>Skiing and snowboarding involve inherent risks, and we are not responsible for any injuries or damages that
          may occur as a result of using the app.
